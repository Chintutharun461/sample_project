this is the description of my work 
<br>
        As an Associate of the Finance and Economics Club at IIT Guwahati, I conducted in-depth equity research on two major companies, ICICI Bank and Caplin Pharmaceuticals. By meticulously analyzing their annual reports, financial statements, and market trends, I prepared comprehensive equity reports to simplify key metrics and insights for investors and stakeholders. These reports provided actionable recommendations, enabling stakeholders to better understand balance sheets and make informed financial decisions. This experience honed my analytical, research, and reporting skills, emphasizing precision and strategic insight in financial analysis.
